# LibreScoot

⚠️ **WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL - DO NOT USE ON REAL HARDWARE** ⚠️

This project aims to create a free and open source firmware for iMX6-based electric scooters. It is currently in early development stages and **will brick your scooter** if installed. This is a research project and should not be used on any real hardware yet.

## Requirements
- Any Linux distribution
- Docker

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/librescoot/librescoot.git
cd openscoot
./run.sh
```

## Current Status
This is heavily work-in-progress. The codebase is unstable and changing rapidly. At this stage, the project is for development and research purposes only.

## Goals
- Create a fully open source scooter firmware
- Improve safety through transparency
- Enable community-driven development and customization
